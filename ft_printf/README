============|| TEST FILE FORMAT ||============

# means the beginning of a comment
Main and bonus test lines cannot be removed or edited, neither the order can be changed
There may be no tests in section
Tests can be separated by any number of empty lines
The number of fields must be exactly 9
The difference between main and bonus test is only in the result printing format. You may put bonus tests in the main section, however you may run into the situation when your bonus field values won't be displayed in the result table.

If you fail in tests input format, this will ruin the whole testing.
If you fail in tests input values, this will ruin the tests compilation.

===| Tests format: |===

Every field, if empty, can be marked as "-" or "". In no way it can be skipped.

00: n$
	Optional. Also can be used to write full argument up to the next %, included.
	Examples: "2$", "1$02.3d   %".
	Remember to include the used argument to arguments field.

01: flags
	Optional. Six default flags are ` `, `0`, `+`, `-`, `#`, `'`. Can be written in any order and number, one after another. `#` should be written as "\#"
	Example: " 0+-\#'"

02: width
	Optional. Can be written as number and *number$.
	Remember to include the used argument to arguments field.

03: precision
	Optional. If used, must always starts with . Can be written as .number, .*number$.
	Remember to include the used argument to arguments field.

04: lengthes
	Optional. If the number of lengthes is more than 1, they must be separated by |. If you want to include missing length, you must mark it as "-|other_flags", otherwise it will be ignored. Example: "-|hh|ll"

05: types
	Must contain at least one type. Example: "diouxX"

06: arguments
	Optional. The arguments that are going after the fmt string. Should be separated by , if more than one is used. Example: "1, 'c', n"

07: code piece
	Optional. This is where you can print some code. For example, set the locale or create a variable. The code will be added to the beginning of the testing. If you need some extra headers, include them to resources/tools/test_headers.h Do not use \n. Example: "int n = 1; void *p = (void*)&n;"

08: extra printing.
	Optional. This was implemented for testing the %n type. This is what will be printed among with the casual test, after it. Example: "%n".

The more field values are used in same test, the longer it will tace to compile it.
In no way should test execution last longer than compilation. Neither it should segfault, etc.

-----

You can set UNDEF at 1 in testmaker.c in order to not avoid undefined behaviour tests. By default, such cases are skipped even if they are included to the test.

Test fail log is put to the ./fails.
